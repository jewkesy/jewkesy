# Hi, I'm Daryl ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software developer who has an extensive background in creating content-rich web applications and background services using established technologies and design patterns.

Amazon Alexa development has become an obsession over the last 4 years. My most popular Skill Popcorn Quiz, released in May 2017, stormed into the Top 10 Featured, Recommend, Staff Picks and Most Popular categories on the Amazon homepage and has stayed there for over 2 years now. 

I'm currently working with Node.JS and MongoDB, this is evident if you take a look at my repos. I'm loving the performance and scalability of the MEAN stack and the friendly, pro-active community support that comes with it - a refreshing change from my time working on .NET solutions.

You can also find me on the education discussion boards at MongoDB, which I'm a heavy contributor to since starting a series of online training certifications.
